TODO List:

- Determine how to get access to audio device when kodi running. No audio playing at the moment.
-- Need to add asound.conf file to /storage/config/ folder so that correct device is selected.

- mdns-responder currently conflicts with avahi-daemon on port 5353. This prevents discovery working so spotify apps (e.g. on iOS, android, desktop) can't see there is a Spotify Connect device on the network. If avahi is stopped and librespot is restarted, discovery occurs and subsequently credentials are sourced from the cache.

- After selecting, librespot from the clients app, the song is loaded but when play is selected, librespot panics and exits: http://pastebin.com/DXDuKQBJ
